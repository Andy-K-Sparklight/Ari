# Ari Launcher

## About

Ari is a third-party Minecraft Launcher which is SUPER EASY to use.

Originally this is called **Alicorn The Corrupted Heart** in memorizing the previous work [Alicorn](https://github.com/Andy-K-Sparklight/Alicorn). The name **Ari** comes from the spelling of "Alicorn" in Japanese: アリコーン (Arikōn).

## Motivation

Actually I'm not playing Minecraft any longer. However, haven't left a work good enough is a pity. So I designed this super easy-going launcher. I hope it can solve some problems buy introducting more people into this game.
